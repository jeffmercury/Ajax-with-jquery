<h3>Stellar black holes</h3>

<p>Black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small but incredibly dense. For example, these objects can pack more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a small city. This insane amount of density is what causes the astronomical amount of gravitational force which surrounds a black hole. Stellar black holes then consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, this in turns adds to their evergrowing size. According to scientists, the Milky Way contains a few hundred million" stellar black holes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Supermassive black holes</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Small black holes may make up take up the majority of black holes in space, but supermassive black holes are the ones that dominate, even though they are roughly around the same diameter. We now believe that supermassive black holes can be found at the center of every galaxy. Yes, that even means ours. No one knows how they are formed. It is theorized that they may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge together.</p>
