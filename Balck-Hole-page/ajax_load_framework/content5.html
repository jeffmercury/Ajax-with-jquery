<h2>The future and Black Holes?</h2>

<p>If you have watched any science fiction movie centered around space, you may have seen the characters using a Black Hole to travel through space or even through time. This may not be plausible because as we recently discussed, our theories tell us that if anything were to enter a Black Hole, the object's atoms would be stretched followed by gaining extreme heat before being subsequently destroyed. This is just a theory though. Black Holes may help us gain the capabilities necessary to achieve feats we never thought possible.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, physicist Jeff Steinhauer from Technion University in Haifa, Israel, was able to create a Black Hole from manipulating sound. This year, NASA created and publicly released a computer-generated visual of how gravity warps our view of Black Holes, which can be found <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-10-02/nasa-black-hole-visualisation/11563802" target="_blank">here</a>. This is a testament to our growth technologically as a species. We went from having limited knowledge derived from outdated observation tools to capturing real images of objects in space.
