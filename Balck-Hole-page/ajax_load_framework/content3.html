<h2>What happens inside a Black Hole?</h2>
<img src="images/img3.jpg"  alt="Pearing into a black hole"/>
<p>Life inside a Black Hole is not completely known. Light cannot escape a black hole, so we have to infer on the effects the black hole has on other celestial bodies like suns and large gas clouds.</p>
<p>If you were to drift into a Black Holes mouth, you would fill like you were freefalling, then you would go from existing to nothing in a blink of an eye. You might not even be able to comprehend whats going on For people watching you, the closer you got to the Black Holes Event horizon, the faster you will begin to accelerate while also beginning to stretch out. The closer you got to the event horizon, the slower you will begin to travel until you stop. You will then begin to burn up until you are nothing but ash. Life in a Black Hole doesn't sound very lively</p>
