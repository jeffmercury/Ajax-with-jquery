<h2>How are black holes formed?</h2>

<p>Interesting enough, all Black Holes start life as a star. When massive stars reach the ends of their lives. The hydrogen that they have been fusing to form helium, which they use for energy is almost gone. Once that happens, the star begins burning helium it's self, which causes the remaining atoms in the star to fuse into heavier elements like gold up to the final point of forming iron. These heavier elements are not a sufficient source of energy for the star. This causes the star's outer layers to collapes towards the star's core then violently out. This is known as a Supernova.</p>

<p>After the explosion, a small part of the star remains. Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity predict that if the remnant has close to about three times the mass of Earth's sun, the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole. this new Black Hole will exert a gravitational force so strong that it will overwhelm everything else and the material it's made of will be crushed to an infinitely small point with infinite density.&nbsp;</p>
