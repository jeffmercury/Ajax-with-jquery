<h2>Will we fall into a black hole?</h2>

<p >Black Holes may seem like they act akin to&nbsp;whirlpools, pulling everything towards their center's, but in fact, they are very much stationary. They only pull things in that travel directly into them. That's how black holes can live in the center of galaxies without completely destroying them.</p>

<p>There are millions of small Black Holes that currently exist in the universe. Some as old as the Universe its self. Every sun has the potential to form into a Black Hole. This could mean that they are a necessity to the universe. They consume objects that fall into them and there are always new celestial bodies being created. This keeps the cycle of creation and destruction going. We hope that our understanding over time increases so we can use the knowledge to help further mankind.</p>
